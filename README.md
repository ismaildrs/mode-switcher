# Mode Switcher Project

Welcome to the Mode Switcher project! This project was created as an opportunity to practice JavaScript skills by implementing a mode switcher that toggles between dark and light modes.

## Overview

The Mode Switcher allows users to toggle between two different visual modes:

- **Dark Mode:** Provides a darker color scheme, which is often easier on the eyes in low-light environments.
  
- **Light Mode:** Offers a lighter color scheme, suitable for well-lit environments and a more traditional appearance.

The primary goal of this project is to practice JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Features

- **Mode Switching:** The main feature of this project is the ability to switch between dark and light modes with the click of a button.

- **Responsive Design:** The mode switcher is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
